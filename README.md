# spotify-clone-using-HTML-CSS-
This Spotify clone is a static webpage built with HTML and CSS, featuring a sidebar for navigation, a main content area with music suggestions and playlists, and a bottom "Now Playing" bar with song info and player controls. It mimics Spotify's dark-themed UI using Flexbox for a clean, responsive layout.
